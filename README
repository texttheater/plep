plep -- grep for Prolog terms
=============================

Requirements
------------

* SWI-Prolog 5.11 or higher
* GNU make or similar

Building
--------

$ make

Usage
-----

$ ./bin/plep [OPTIONS] TERM [FILE...]

TERM is a Prolog term given as a string. plep will search the FILEs and print
out every term that unifies with TERM and is not a subterm of any previously
printed term.

Options
-------

    -m FILE
    --module FILE
        Use the operator defintions provided by the module in FILE for parsing
        both TERM and the input files. For parsing non-module files with custom
        operators, it is recommended to create a module (say myops) that
        defines all the needed operators.
